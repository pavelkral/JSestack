# JSestack alfa 0.0.1

Basic devpack and build setup by webpack tools for writing frontend REACT flux pattern application in es6+
Included a few basic examples from web rewrited to es6+.Not included tests and task manager(mocha/jest gulp/grunt everybody prefer something else).
Just one config file and four oneline shell build scripts.Also good for start with REACT in es6+ and understand webpack tools.
 
## Build
 
  ```shell

	npm install
	build.sh  // build with source map	
	dist.sh  // build final and minimize app to dist folder
  
  ```

## Live compiling and live reload

  ```shell
  		watch.sh // run webpack live compile mode
  		watch.sh // run webpack live compile mode with dev server on port 8080 with live reload

  ```
